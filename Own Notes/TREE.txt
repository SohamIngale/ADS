Tree
- non linear data structure
- heirarchial data structure that is needed to represent adn organize data in a waay is easy to navigate and search.


Node -> structure -> which holds data
Edges -> connections bw two nodes
Degree of Nodes

Relationship of Tree is Parent Child based

CYCLE DOES NOT EXIST IN A TREE
CYCLE EXISTS IN A GRAPH




TYPES OF TREES:
---------------
tree
binary tree
ternary tree
n-array tree





BINARY TREE:
------------

no. of children <=2 -> {0,1,2}

a BT is a tree in which every node has 2 children.

BT in which each node can have atmost 2 children, namely, left and right children

TYPES OF BT IN ACC TO LEFT AND RIGHT CHILD

1. STRICTLY BT
2. FULL BT
3. COMPLETE BT

1. STRICTLY BT
	no single child {0,2}
	a BT in which every node, except for the leaf nodes, has non empty left and right children
	
2. FULL BT

	A FULL BINARY TREE is also known as PROPER BINARY TREE / 2 TREE, in which all the nodes other than leaf nodes have exact 2 nodes.
	
	
	left sub tree and right sub tree are balanced.
	left sub tree == right sub tree
	level wise tree is complete
	Full = level wise complete
	
3. COMPLETE BT

	tree with n nodes and depth d whose nodes corresponds to the nodes numbered from 0 to n-1 in full binary tree of depth k.
	
	
	ACOMPLETE BINARY TREE - is a binary tree at which every level except possibly the last, has to be filled and all nodes are as far left as possible.
	


LEFT/RIGHT SKEWED TREE are DEGENERATED TREES/UNBALANCED TREES/UNBALANCED

WE HAVE TO CHANGE UNBALANCED TREES TO BALANCED TREES

BALANCED TREES:
----------------

1. Binary Search Tree

2. AVL Tree

3. Red-Black Tree

4. B Tree

5. B+ Trees

binary tree ke saare default properties inherit hojati hai in balanced trees



1. Binary Search Tree (BST):

	search : fastest search and identify an element
	
	LC VALUE < = ROOT VALUE
	RC VALUE > = ROOT VALUE
	
	insert node..
	
	insertdata(Node root, int key)
	
	
	
	
	
BALANCED SEARCHED TREE
