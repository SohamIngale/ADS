
ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS:
---------------------
										//PRIORI ANALYSIS
Algorithm:
	-Design
	-Domain knowledge
	-Language
	-Hardware and Operating System
	-Analysis
	
	//PRIORI ANALYSIS
	-analysis
	- independent of pl and hardware
	- Time and space analysis
	
	
	
Programs:
	-Implementation
	-Programmers
	-Programming Language
	-Hardware and Operating System
	-Testing


	//POSTERIOR ANALYSIS
	-programs
	-dependent of pl
	-dependent on hardware
	-time complexity analysis
	
	
	
Algorithm Complexity:
-------------------

1. Time Complexity:
	-Time is measured by counting the number of key operations such as comparisons in sorting algorithm.

2. Space Complexity:
	-Space is measured by counting the max. memory space reqd by the algorithm.
	
	
Asymptotic Notations:
---------------------
- Asymptotic analysis of an algorithm referes to defining mathematical boundaries of its runtime performance.
- can be defined in following terms:
	- best case scenarios
			min time reqd for program execution
	- avg case
			avg time reqd for program execution
	//interview ke liye avg and worst case scenarios
	- worst case
			max time reqd for program execution
