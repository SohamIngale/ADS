Certainly! Let's create a table comparing the sorting algorithms based on their pros and cons, along with real-time examples:

| Algorithm      | Pros                                                  | Cons                                                    	 | Real-time Example                                |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------  |--------------------------------------------------|
| Insertion Sort | - Simple implementation                               | - Inefficient for large datasets (O(n^2) time complexity) | Sorting playing cards in your hand             	|
|                | - Efficient for small datasets or nearly sorted arrays| - Not suitable for large datasets                         |                                                	|
| Bubble Sort    | - Simple implementation                               | - Inefficient for large datasets (O(n^2) time complexity) | Sorting bubbles rising in a glass of water     	|
|                | - Easy to understand and implement                    | - Very slow compared to other algorithms                  |                                                	|
| Selection Sort | - Simple implementation                               | - Inefficient for large datasets (O(n^2) time complexity) | Selecting the smallest fruit from a basket     	|
|                | - In-place sorting                                    | - Does not adapt well to partially sorted arrays          |                                                	|
| Merge Sort     | - Stable                                              | - Requires additional space (O(n) space complexity)       | Merging two sorted lists                       	|
|                | - Guaranteed O(n log n) time complexity               | - Slower in practice for small datasets compared to quicksort |                                            	|
| Quicksort      | - Efficient for large datasets (O(n log n) average time complexity) | - Not stable by default                     | Sorting objects based on their heights quickly 	|
|                | - In-place sorting                                    | - Worst-case time complexity can degrade to O(n^2)        |                                                	|
| Heapsort       | - Guaranteed O(n log n) time complexity               | - Not stable by default                                   | Organizing a priority queue                    	|
|                | - In-place sorting                                    | - Slower in practice compared to quicksort and mergesort  |                                                	|

These are general pros and cons of each algorithm. The choice of which algorithm to use depends on factors such as the size and distribution of the data, memory constraints, stability requirements, and performance considerations.
